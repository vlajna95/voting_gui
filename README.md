# Voting GUI 

A simple GUI to vote for a choice, consuming my [voting API](https://github.com/vlajna95/voting/) hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/). 

It's really simple. Create and start your virtual environment, clone this repo, install the requirements from the provided file, and woala! 

Edit voting_gui.py and change your default URL (the _API_ROOT_ variable). Then run the app starting the file with Python. 

```bash
python voting_gui.py
```

You should provide the username and password used to access the API. 

If you want to consume another API with different login parameters, you must close the file, edit it and start it again in Python, using the adecuate login data for the API you configured.
